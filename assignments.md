# Response Papers (25%)

Every week you will write a response paper based on the readings. Response papers should not be summaries nor mere paraphrases. They need not inform the reader (in this case, the seminar participants) of things we could all glean from the readings, but situating them within their historical, intellectual or polemical context, could be useful. Response papers should present a critical and dialectical engagement with the texts, which could mean clarifying a concept or notion, fleshing out implicit ideas or presuppositions, reconstructing, analyzing or debunking an argument, drawing consequences or exposing what remains unsaid in the text. Your response should focus on passages, concepts or ideas that intrigued you. Particularly fruitful are perplexing or seemingly enigmatic formulations, dense passages, conceptual turns, but also moments of dissonance or inconsistencies.

Your oral presentation hand-out counts as a response paper, and you can skip one, for a total of ten. From these, you must choose (and indicate at the time of handing them in) five response papers to be graded. 

Extension: one page, single-spaced.

# Midterm Exam-Commentary 

The midterm exam will gauge your familiarity with the works read during the first half of the semester as well as your critical acumen as an interpreter of theoretical texts. You will choose one from among three passages and write a **critical-philosophical commentary** on the text. The commentary should begin by framing the passage within the general argument of the work, gauging its relative significance in relation to it, and providing any crucial information omitted from the passage in question. You should then begin a systematic exposition of the passage, fleshing out tacit or implied arguments, filling in all lacunae or elisions, and clarifying all relevant notions, concepts or key terms.

This is an open-book take-home exam.

Extension: three to four pages, single-spaced.
