This course presents a historical survey of literary theory as it emerged from and then outgrew the study of literary texts. The course traces literary theoryâ€™s origins in the textual scholarship of the early modern period, its consolidation into a classic form during the twentieth century, and the proliferation of new approaches made possible by the demise of the literary text as an autonomous entity.
